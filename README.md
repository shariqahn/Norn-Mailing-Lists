### Norn Mailing List System

This is an email list management system created for 6.031 Software Construction. With the use of tools such as recursive data types, regular expressions, and parsers, this allows the user to create and manage email lists by inputing particular expressions. See more details [here](http://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/fa19/projects/norn/).

This project was created by Shariqah Hossain, Violetta Jusiega, and [Samantha Sappenfield](https://github.com/ssappenf).
